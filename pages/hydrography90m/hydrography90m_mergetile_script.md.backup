Here is a bash scripiting procedure to merge tiled raster and vector files of the Hydrography90m dataset. Please see the paper by [Amatulli et al. (2022)](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2022-9) for further details.

##  Merge tiled raster files 

    gdalbuildvrt basin.vrt basin_h16v02.tif basin_h16v03.tif
    gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co ZLEVEL=9 basin.vrt  basin.tif

##  Merge tiled vector files 

    ogrmerge.py -single -progress -skipfailures -overwrite_ds -f GPKG -o basin.gpkg  basin_h16v02.gpkg basin_h16v03.gpkg
    rm -f basin_dissolved.gpkg  
    ogr2ogr  -nlt POLYGON -dialect sqlite -sql "SELECT ST_Union(ST_MakeValid(geom)),"ID" FROM merged GROUP BY "ID" " basin_dissolved.gpkg basin.gpkg


    ogr2ogr -nlt POLYGON -dialect sqlite -sql "SELECT ST_Union(ST_MakeValid(geom)),"ID" FROM merged GROUP BY "ID" " sub_catchment_dissolved.gpkg sub_catchment.gpkg

####  We will gradually add more functions for merging, masking etc. the layers in bash, Python and R.
